## Stage File Format

The stage file is a **15x15** grid .txt file consisting of object discriminators for specifying each cell type and spawnpoint. Each descriminator is separated by:<br>
A bar ("**|**") for each **COLUMN**<br>
A **newline** for each **ROW**<br>
<br>

**Object Discriminators:**
+ **EMPTY CELL:** " " OR str(1 to  15)
    - The discriminator can either be a **SPACE** or a number from 1 to 15.
    - Numbers are for easier counting and positioning
    - This is only for the designer, as they can put any number in any designated empty cell regardless of where it is
+ **BRICK:** Brick
+ **CRACKED BRICK:** CrackedBrick
+ **STONE:** Stone
+ **WATER:** Water
+ **FOREST:** Forest
+ **HOME:** Home
+ **MIRROR CELL (Northeast side):** MirrorNE
+ **MIRROR CELL (Southeast side):** MirrorSE
+ **PLAYER SPAWNPOINT:** Spawn
+ **ENEMY SPAWNPOINT:** EnemySpawn

<br>

**Additional Notes:**
+ On the left and right edges, there must still be a space or number if you wish to specify an empty cell.
+ Please see [resources/stages/_TEST.txt](resources/stages/_TEST.txt) for a complete example.
